## Overview
This is the side hustle internship task for week 2. The task is to create the Fylo dark theme landing page using only HTML and pure CSS. 
The task requires the website be responsive across all devices with the help of CSS flexbox or grid without using any framework.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

While working through this project, I learnt a lot about CSS flexbox and how to use it. I also learnt that is important to use the Mobile-First
workflow.

### Continued development

I would like to improve on using CSS flexbox and CSS grid layout so I am going to build more websites make them responsive using CSS flexbox and grid.
